PocketBase Admin dashboard UI
======================================================================

This is the PocketBase Admin dashboard UI (built with Svelte and Vite).

Although it could be used independently, it is mainly intended to be embedded
as part of a PocketBase app executable (hence the `embed.go` file).

## Development

Download the repo and run the appropriate console commands:

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# start a dev server with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# or generate production ready bundle in dist/ directory
npm run build
```
