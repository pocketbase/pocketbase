/**
 * Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system
 * functionality. The design is Unix-like, although the error handling is
 * Go-like; failing calls return values of type error rather than error numbers.
 * Often, more information is available within the error. For example,
 * if a call that takes a file name fails, such as Open or Stat, the error
 * will include the failing file name when printed and will be of type
 * *PathError, which may be unpacked for more information.
 * 
 * The os interface is intended to be uniform across all operating systems.
 * Features not generally available appear in the system-specific package syscall.
 * 
 * Here is a simple example, opening a file and reading some of it.
 * 
 * ```
 * 	file, err := os.Open("file.go") // For read access.
 * 	if err != nil {
 * 		log.Fatal(err)
 * 	}
 * ```
 * 
 * If the open fails, the error string will be self-explanatory, like
 * 
 * ```
 * 	open file.go: no such file or directory
 * ```
 * 
 * The file's data can then be read into a slice of bytes. Read and
 * Write take their byte counts from the length of the argument slice.
 * 
 * ```
 * 	data := make([]byte, 100)
 * 	count, err := file.Read(data)
 * 	if err != nil {
 * 		log.Fatal(err)
 * 	}
 * 	fmt.Printf("read %d bytes: %q\n", count, data[:count])
 * ```
 * 
 * Note: The maximum number of concurrent operations on a File may be limited by
 * the OS or the system. The number should be high, but exceeding it may degrade
 * performance or cause other issues.

/**
 * Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
 * 
 * The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with
 * no leap seconds.
 * 
 * Monotonic Clocks
 * 
 * Operating systems provide both a “wall clock,” which is subject to
 * changes for clock synchronization, and a “monotonic clock,” which is
 * not. The general rule is that the wall clock is for telling time and
 * the monotonic clock is for measuring time. Rather than split the API,
 * in this package the Time returned by time.Now contains both a wall
 * clock reading and a monotonic clock reading; later time-telling
 * operations use the wall clock reading, but later time-measuring
 * operations, specifically comparisons and subtractions, use the
 * monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * For example, this code always computes a positive elapsed time of
 * approximately 20 milliseconds, even if the wall clock is changed during
 * the operation being timed:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	start := time.Now()
 * 	... operation that takes 20 milliseconds ...
 * 	t := time.Now()
 * 	elapsed := t.Sub(start)
 * ```
 * 
 * Other idioms, such as time.Since(start), time.Until(deadline), and
 * time.Now().Before(deadline), are similarly robust against wall clock
 * resets.
 * 
 * The rest of this section gives the precise details of how operations
 * use monotonic clocks, but understanding those details is not required
 * to use this package.
 * 
 * The Time returned by time.Now contains a monotonic clock reading.
 * If Time t has a monotonic clock reading, t.Add adds the same duration to
 * both the wall clock and monotonic clock readings to compute the result.
 * Because t.AddDate(y, m, d), t.Round(d), and t.Truncate(d) are wall time
 * computations, they always strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * Because t.In, t.Local, and t.UTC are used for their effect on the interpretation
 * of the wall time, they also strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * The canonical way to strip a monotonic clock reading is to use t = t.Round(0).
 * 
 * If Times t and u both contain monotonic clock readings, the operations
 * t.After(u), t.Before(u), t.Equal(u), and t.Sub(u) are carried out
 * using the monotonic clock readings alone, ignoring the wall clock
 * readings. If either t or u contains no monotonic clock reading, these
 * operations fall back to using the wall clock readings.
 * 
 * On some systems the monotonic clock will stop if the computer goes to sleep.
 * On such a system, t.Sub(u) may not accurately reflect the actual
 * time that passed between t and u.
 * 
 * Because the monotonic clock reading has no meaning outside
 * the current process, the serialized forms generated by t.GobEncode,
 * t.MarshalBinary, t.MarshalJSON, and t.MarshalText omit the monotonic
 * clock reading, and t.Format provides no format for it. Similarly, the
 * constructors time.Date, time.Parse, time.ParseInLocation, and time.Unix,
 * as well as the unmarshalers t.GobDecode, t.UnmarshalBinary.
 * t.UnmarshalJSON, and t.UnmarshalText always create times with
 * no monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but
 * also the Location and the monotonic clock reading. See the
 * documentation for the Time type for a discussion of equality
 * testing for Time values.
 * 
 * For debugging, the result of t.String does include the monotonic
 * clock reading if present. If t != u because of different monotonic clock readings,
 * that difference will be visible when printing t.String() and u.String().

  * As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero method gives
  * a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly.
  * 
  * Each Time has associated with it a Location, consulted when computing the
  * presentation form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods.
  * The methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific location.
  * Changing the location in this way changes only the presentation; it does not
  * change the instant in time being denoted and therefore does not affect the

  * 
  * Representations of a Time value saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary,

  * for comparison or subtraction.
  * See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for details.

  * be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the
  * identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved
  * through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock reading
  * has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u)

  * argument "dir/a".
  *

  * The error result returned by the function controls how WalkDir
  * continues. If the function returns the special value SkipDir, WalkDir
  * skips the current directory (path if d.IsDir() is true, otherwise
  * path's parent directory). Otherwise, if the function returns a non-nil
  * error, WalkDir stops entirely and returns that error.
  * 
  * The err argument reports an error related to path, signaling that
  * WalkDir will not walk into that directory. The function can decide how
  * to handle that error; as described earlier, returning the error will
  * cause WalkDir to stop walking the entire tree.
  * 
  * WalkDir calls the function with a non-nil err argument in two cases.
  * 
  * First, if the initial fs.Stat on the root directory fails, WalkDir
  * calls the function with path set to root, d set to nil, and err set to
  * the error from fs.Stat.
  * 
  * Second, if a directory's ReadDir method fails, WalkDir calls the
  * function with path set to the directory's path, d set to an
  * fs.DirEntry describing the directory, and err set to the error from
  * ReadDir. In this second case, the function is called twice with the
  * path of the directory: the first call is before the directory read is
  * attempted and has err set to nil, giving the function a chance to
  * return SkipDir and avoid the ReadDir entirely. The second call is
  * after a failed ReadDir and reports the error from ReadDir.
  * (If ReadDir succeeds, there is no second call.)
  * 
  * The differences between WalkDirFunc compared to filepath.WalkFunc are:
  * 
  * ```
  *   - The second argument has type fs.DirEntry instead of fs.FileInfo.
  *   - The function is called before reading a directory, to allow SkipDir
  *     to bypass the directory read entirely.
  *   - If a directory read fails, the function is called a second time
  *     for that directory to report the error.

 * can do so by setting Transport.TLSNextProto (for clients) or
 * Server.TLSNextProto (for servers) to a non-nil, empty
 * map. Alternatively, the following GODEBUG environment variables are
 * currently supported:

   *    *any
   *    *RawBytes
   *    *Rows (cursor value)
   *    any type implementing Scanner (see Scanner docs)
   * ```
   * 
   * In the most simple case, if the type of the value from the source
   * column is an integer, bool or string type T and dest is of type *T,

   * 
   * Scan also converts between string and numeric types, as long as no
   * information would be lost. While Scan stringifies all numbers
   * scanned from numeric database columns into *string, scans into
   * numeric types are checked for overflow. For example, a float64 with
   * value 300 or a string with value "300" can scan into a uint16, but
   * not into a uint8, though float64(255) or "255" can scan into a
   * uint8. One exception is that scans of some float64 numbers to
   * strings may lose information when stringifying. In general, scan
   * floating point columns into *float64.
   * 
   * If a dest argument has type *[]byte, Scan saves in that argument a
   * copy of the corresponding data. The copy is owned by the caller and
   * can be modified and held indefinitely. The copy can be avoided by
   * using an argument of type *RawBytes instead; see the documentation
   * for RawBytes for restrictions on its use.
   * 
   * If an argument has type *any, Scan copies the value
   * provided by the underlying driver without conversion. When scanning
   * from a source value of type []byte to *any, a copy of the
   * slice is made and the caller owns the result.
   * 
   * Source values of type time.Time may be scanned into values of type
   * *time.Time, *any, *string, or *[]byte. When converting to
   * the latter two, time.RFC3339Nano is used.
   * 
   * Source values of type bool may be scanned into types *bool,
   * *any, *string, *[]byte, or *RawBytes.
   * 
   * For scanning into *bool, the source may be true, false, 1, 0, or
   * string inputs parseable by strconv.ParseBool.
   * 
   * Scan can also convert a cursor returned from a query, such as
   * "select cursor(select * from my_table) from dual", into a

/**
 * Package blob provides an easy and portable way to interact with blobs
 * within a storage location. Subpackages contain driver implementations of
 * blob for supported services.
 * 
 * See https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/ for a detailed how-to guide.
 * 
 * *blob.Bucket implements io/fs.FS and io/fs.SubFS, so it can be used with
 * functions in that package.
 * 
 * # Errors
 * 
 * The errors returned from this package can be inspected in several ways:
 * 
 * The Code function from gocloud.dev/gcerrors will return an error code, also
 * defined in that package, when invoked on an error.
 * 
 * The Bucket.ErrorAs method can retrieve the driver error underlying the returned
 * error.
 * 
 * # OpenCensus Integration
 * 
 * OpenCensus supports tracing and metric collection for multiple languages and
 * backend providers. See https://opencensus.io.
 * 
 * This API collects OpenCensus traces and metrics for the following methods:
 * ```
 *   - Attributes
 *   - Copy
 *   - Delete
 *   - ListPage
 *   - NewRangeReader, from creation until the call to Close. (NewReader and ReadAll
 *     are included because they call NewRangeReader.)
 *   - NewWriter, from creation until the call to Close.
 * ```
 * 
 * All trace and metric names begin with the package import path.
 * The traces add the method name.
 * For example, "gocloud.dev/blob/Attributes".
 * The metrics are "completed_calls", a count of completed method calls by driver,
 * method and status (error code); and "latency", a distribution of method latency
 * by driver and method.
 * For example, "gocloud.dev/blob/latency".
 * 
 * It also collects the following metrics:
 * ```
 *   - gocloud.dev/blob/bytes_read: the total number of bytes read, by driver.
 *   - gocloud.dev/blob/bytes_written: the total number of bytes written, by driver.
 * ```
 * 
 * To enable trace collection in your application, see "Configure Exporter" at
 * https://opencensus.io/quickstart/go/tracing.
 * To enable metric collection in your application, see "Exporting stats" at
 * https://opencensus.io/quickstart/go/metrics.

/**
 * Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
 * 
 * The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with
 * no leap seconds.
 * 
 * Monotonic Clocks
 * 
 * Operating systems provide both a “wall clock,” which is subject to
 * changes for clock synchronization, and a “monotonic clock,” which is
 * not. The general rule is that the wall clock is for telling time and
 * the monotonic clock is for measuring time. Rather than split the API,
 * in this package the Time returned by time.Now contains both a wall
 * clock reading and a monotonic clock reading; later time-telling
 * operations use the wall clock reading, but later time-measuring
 * operations, specifically comparisons and subtractions, use the
 * monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * For example, this code always computes a positive elapsed time of
 * approximately 20 milliseconds, even if the wall clock is changed during
 * the operation being timed:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	start := time.Now()
 * 	... operation that takes 20 milliseconds ...
 * 	t := time.Now()
 * 	elapsed := t.Sub(start)
 * ```
 * 
 * Other idioms, such as time.Since(start), time.Until(deadline), and
 * time.Now().Before(deadline), are similarly robust against wall clock
 * resets.
 * 
 * The rest of this section gives the precise details of how operations
 * use monotonic clocks, but understanding those details is not required
 * to use this package.
 * 
 * The Time returned by time.Now contains a monotonic clock reading.
 * If Time t has a monotonic clock reading, t.Add adds the same duration to
 * both the wall clock and monotonic clock readings to compute the result.
 * Because t.AddDate(y, m, d), t.Round(d), and t.Truncate(d) are wall time
 * computations, they always strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * Because t.In, t.Local, and t.UTC are used for their effect on the interpretation
 * of the wall time, they also strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * The canonical way to strip a monotonic clock reading is to use t = t.Round(0).
 * 
 * If Times t and u both contain monotonic clock readings, the operations
 * t.After(u), t.Before(u), t.Equal(u), and t.Sub(u) are carried out
 * using the monotonic clock readings alone, ignoring the wall clock
 * readings. If either t or u contains no monotonic clock reading, these
 * operations fall back to using the wall clock readings.
 * 
 * On some systems the monotonic clock will stop if the computer goes to sleep.
 * On such a system, t.Sub(u) may not accurately reflect the actual
 * time that passed between t and u.
 * 
 * Because the monotonic clock reading has no meaning outside
 * the current process, the serialized forms generated by t.GobEncode,
 * t.MarshalBinary, t.MarshalJSON, and t.MarshalText omit the monotonic
 * clock reading, and t.Format provides no format for it. Similarly, the
 * constructors time.Date, time.Parse, time.ParseInLocation, and time.Unix,
 * as well as the unmarshalers t.GobDecode, t.UnmarshalBinary.
 * t.UnmarshalJSON, and t.UnmarshalText always create times with
 * no monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but
 * also the Location and the monotonic clock reading. See the
 * documentation for the Time type for a discussion of equality
 * testing for Time values.
 * 
 * For debugging, the result of t.String does include the monotonic
 * clock reading if present. If t != u because of different monotonic clock readings,
 * that difference will be visible when printing t.String() and u.String().

/**
 * Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
 * cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries
 * and between processes.
 * 
 * Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing
 * calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function
 * calls between them must propagate the Context, optionally replacing
 * it with a derived Context created using WithCancel, WithDeadline,
 * WithTimeout, or WithValue. When a Context is canceled, all
 * Contexts derived from it are also canceled.
 * 
 * The WithCancel, WithDeadline, and WithTimeout functions take a
 * Context (the parent) and return a derived Context (the child) and a
 * CancelFunc. Calling the CancelFunc cancels the child and its
 * children, removes the parent's reference to the child, and stops
 * any associated timers. Failing to call the CancelFunc leaks the
 * child and its children until the parent is canceled or the timer
 * fires. The go vet tool checks that CancelFuncs are used on all
 * control-flow paths.
 * 
 * Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
 * consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context
 * propagation:
 * 
 * Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
 * explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first
 * parameter, typically named ctx:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
 * 		// ... use ctx ...
 * 	}
 * ```
 * 
 * Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass context.TODO
 * if you are unsure about which Context to use.
 * 
 * Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
 * APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
 * 
 * The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines;
 * Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
 * 
 * See https://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses
 * Contexts.

/**
 * Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including
 * TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.
 * 
 * Although the package provides access to low-level networking
 * primitives, most clients will need only the basic interface provided
 * by the Dial, Listen, and Accept functions and the associated
 * Conn and Listener interfaces. The crypto/tls package uses
 * the same interfaces and similar Dial and Listen functions.
 * 
 * The Dial function connects to a server:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "golang.org:80")
 * 	if err != nil {
 * 		// handle error
 * 	}
 * 	fmt.Fprintf(conn, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
 * 	status, err := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
 * 	// ...
 * ```
 * 
 * The Listen function creates servers:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
 * 	if err != nil {
 * 		// handle error
 * 	}
 * 	for {
 * 		conn, err := ln.Accept()
 * 		if err != nil {
 * 			// handle error
 * 		}
 * 		go handleConnection(conn)
 * 	}
 * ```
 * 
 * Name Resolution
 * 
 * The method for resolving domain names, whether indirectly with functions like Dial
 * or directly with functions like LookupHost and LookupAddr, varies by operating system.
 * 
 * On Unix systems, the resolver has two options for resolving names.
 * It can use a pure Go resolver that sends DNS requests directly to the servers
 * listed in /etc/resolv.conf, or it can use a cgo-based resolver that calls C
 * library routines such as getaddrinfo and getnameinfo.
 * 
 * By default the pure Go resolver is used, because a blocked DNS request consumes
 * only a goroutine, while a blocked C call consumes an operating system thread.
 * When cgo is available, the cgo-based resolver is used instead under a variety of
 * conditions: on systems that do not let programs make direct DNS requests (OS X),
 * when the LOCALDOMAIN environment variable is present (even if empty),
 * when the RES_OPTIONS or HOSTALIASES environment variable is non-empty,
 * when the ASR_CONFIG environment variable is non-empty (OpenBSD only),
 * when /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/nsswitch.conf specify the use of features that the
 * Go resolver does not implement, and when the name being looked up ends in .local
 * or is an mDNS name.
 * 
 * The resolver decision can be overridden by setting the netdns value of the
 * GODEBUG environment variable (see package runtime) to go or cgo, as in:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	export GODEBUG=netdns=go    # force pure Go resolver
 * 	export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo   # force cgo resolver
 * ```
 * 
 * The decision can also be forced while building the Go source tree
 * by setting the netgo or netcgo build tag.
 * 
 * A numeric netdns setting, as in GODEBUG=netdns=1, causes the resolver
 * to print debugging information about its decisions.
 * To force a particular resolver while also printing debugging information,
 * join the two settings by a plus sign, as in GODEBUG=netdns=go+1.
 * 
 * On Plan 9, the resolver always accesses /net/cs and /net/dns.
 * 
 * On Windows, the resolver always uses C library functions, such as GetAddrInfo and DnsQuery.

 * ```
 *

 * HTTP/2 protocol when using HTTPS. Programs that must disable HTTP/2
 * can do so by setting Transport.TLSNextProto (for clients) or
 * Server.TLSNextProto (for servers) to a non-nil, empty
 * map. Alternatively, the following GODEBUG environment variables are
 * currently supported:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	GODEBUG=http2client=0  # disable HTTP/2 client support
 * 	GODEBUG=http2server=0  # disable HTTP/2 server support
 * 	GODEBUG=http2debug=1   # enable verbose HTTP/2 debug logs

 * 
 * Name Resolution
 * 
 * The method for resolving domain names, whether indirectly with functions like Dial
 * or directly with functions like LookupHost and LookupAddr, varies by operating system.
 * 
 * On Unix systems, the resolver has two options for resolving names.
 * It can use a pure Go resolver that sends DNS requests directly to the servers
 * listed in /etc/resolv.conf, or it can use a cgo-based resolver that calls C
 * library routines such as getaddrinfo and getnameinfo.
 * 
 * By default the pure Go resolver is used, because a blocked DNS request consumes
 * only a goroutine, while a blocked C call consumes an operating system thread.
 * When cgo is available, the cgo-based resolver is used instead under a variety of
 * conditions: on systems that do not let programs make direct DNS requests (OS X),
 * when the LOCALDOMAIN environment variable is present (even if empty),
 * when the RES_OPTIONS or HOSTALIASES environment variable is non-empty,
 * when the ASR_CONFIG environment variable is non-empty (OpenBSD only),
 * when /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/nsswitch.conf specify the use of features that the
 * Go resolver does not implement, and when the name being looked up ends in .local
 * or is an mDNS name.
 * 
 * The resolver decision can be overridden by setting the netdns value of the
 * GODEBUG environment variable (see package runtime) to go or cgo, as in:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	export GODEBUG=netdns=go    # force pure Go resolver
 * 	export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo   # force cgo resolver
 * ```
 * 
 * The decision can also be forced while building the Go source tree
 * by setting the netgo or netcgo build tag.
 * 
 * A numeric netdns setting, as in GODEBUG=netdns=1, causes the resolver
 * to print debugging information about its decisions.
 * To force a particular resolver while also printing debugging information,
 * join the two settings by a plus sign, as in GODEBUG=netdns=go+1.
 * 
 * On Plan 9, the resolver always accesses /net/cs and /net/dns.
 * 
 * On Windows, the resolver always uses C library functions, such as GetAddrInfo and DnsQuery.

/**
 * Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

 * 	resp, err := http.Post("http://example.com/upload", "image/jpeg", &buf)
 * 	...
 * 	resp, err := http.PostForm("http://example.com/form",
 * 		url.Values{"key": {"Value"}, "id": {"123"}})
 * ```
 * 
 * The client must close the response body when finished with it:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com/")
 * 	if err != nil {
 * 		// handle error
 * 	}
 * 	defer resp.Body.Close()
 * 	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
 * 	// ...
 * ```
 * 
 * For control over HTTP client headers, redirect policy, and other
 * settings, create a Client:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	client := &http.Client{
 * 		CheckRedirect: redirectPolicyFunc,
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	resp, err := client.Get("http://example.com")
 * 	// ...
 * 
 * 	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://example.com", nil)
 * 	// ...
 * 	req.Header.Add("If-None-Match", `W/"wyzzy"`)
 * 	resp, err := client.Do(req)
 * 	// ...
 * ```
 * 
 * For control over proxies, TLS configuration, keep-alives,
 * compression, and other settings, create a Transport:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	tr := &http.Transport{
 * 		MaxIdleConns:       10,
 * 		IdleConnTimeout:    30 * time.Second,
 * 		DisableCompression: true,
 * 	}
 * 	client := &http.Client{Transport: tr}
 * 	resp, err := client.Get("https://example.com")
 * ```
 * 
 * Clients and Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple
 * goroutines and for efficiency should only be created once and re-used.
 * 
 * ListenAndServe starts an HTTP server with a given address and handler.
 * The handler is usually nil, which means to use DefaultServeMux.
 * Handle and HandleFunc add handlers to DefaultServeMux:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	http.Handle("/foo", fooHandler)
 * 
 * 	http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
 * 		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q", html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
 * 	})
 * 
 * 	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
 * ```
 * 
 * More control over the server's behavior is available by creating a
 * custom Server:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	s := &http.Server{
 * 		Addr:           ":8080",
 * 		Handler:        myHandler,
 * 		ReadTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
 * 		WriteTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
 * 		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 << 20,
 * 	}
 * 	log.Fatal(s.ListenAndServe())
 * ```
 * 
 * Starting with Go 1.6, the http package has transparent support for the
 * HTTP/2 protocol when using HTTPS. Programs that must disable HTTP/2
 * can do so by setting Transport.TLSNextProto (for clients) or
 * Server.TLSNextProto (for servers) to a non-nil, empty
 * map. Alternatively, the following GODEBUG environment variables are
 * currently supported:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	GODEBUG=http2client=0  # disable HTTP/2 client support
 * 	GODEBUG=http2server=0  # disable HTTP/2 server support
 * 	GODEBUG=http2debug=1   # enable verbose HTTP/2 debug logs
 * 	GODEBUG=http2debug=2   # ... even more verbose, with frame dumps
 * ```
 * 
 * The GODEBUG variables are not covered by Go's API compatibility
 * promise. Please report any issues before disabling HTTP/2
 * support: https://golang.org/s/http2bug
 * 
 * The http package's Transport and Server both automatically enable
 * HTTP/2 support for simple configurations. To enable HTTP/2 for more
 * complex configurations, to use lower-level HTTP/2 features, or to use
 * a newer version of Go's http2 package, import "golang.org/x/net/http2"
 * directly and use its ConfigureTransport and/or ConfigureServer
 * functions. Manually configuring HTTP/2 via the golang.org/x/net/http2
 * package takes precedence over the net/http package's built-in HTTP/2

 * Package mail implements parsing of mail messages.
 * 
 * For the most part, this package follows the syntax as specified by RFC 5322 and
 * extended by RFC 6532.
 * Notable divergences:
 * ```
 * 	* Obsolete address formats are not parsed, including addresses with
 * 	  embedded route information.
 * 	* The full range of spacing (the CFWS syntax element) is not supported,
 * 	  such as breaking addresses across lines.
 * 	* No unicode normalization is performed.
 * 	* The special characters ()[]:;@\, are allowed to appear unquoted in names.
 * ```
